# Assignment
 This is an assignment I got through my first internship.
 Basically this is an javascript based program which uses a node.js library called Puppeteer.
 Its purpuse is to taking screenshots of all the bootstrap theme or html file present within the site/folder/index.html like a preview.
 
 There are two ways to do it
 
 1. Using JSON File for the path specification or
 2. Applying the readfoler and folder directory path for autodetection of the directory name.

NOTE : Before using it you must have puppeteer module. You can get it but cmd command : npm i puppeteer
